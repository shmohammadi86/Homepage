#My personal homepage#

If you have access to a PHP-enabled web-server, I highly suggests looking into [OpenScholar](http://theopenscholar.org/). Purdue University servers do not support any server-side scripting languages, and I had to write everything using client-side features. All PDF(s) are stored in the "./pdf" folder, where as images are stored in "./images". The main CSS stylesheet is "./styles/default.css"
